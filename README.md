# MYCHP203 — Parallel Optimization Techniques, Spring 2024

## Course Information

### Descrition & Objectives

This class provides an overview of common optimization techniques in parallel & distributed execution contexts. It covers the technical foundations of how to leverage tools such as compiler directives, debuggers, and profilers to optimize HPC applications. By the end of the course, students should have expertise on the main performance issues tied to parallelization: how to identify and fix them.

The students are expected to learn and understand:
- parallel and distributed architectures
- performance analysis methodology: using static and dynamic analysis tools to pinpoint performance hotspots and characterize the performance profile of HPC applications;
- quantitative and qualitative analysis of the main parallel bottlenecks: communication & synchronization overhead, load balancing, network saturation;
- advanced use of compiler builtins, OpenMP directives and intrinsics;
- leveraging parallel debugging tools (DDT, Marmot, Thread Checker), as well as profilers (Tau, Scalasca, MAQAO, Kojak, Vampir, ...).
