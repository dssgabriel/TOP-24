# MYCHP203 â€” Parallel Optimization Techniques, Spring 2024

## Course Information

### Descrition & Objectives

This class provides an overview of common optimization techniques in parallel & distributed execution contexts. It covers the technical foundations of how to leverage tools such as compiler directives, debuggers, and profilers to optimize HPC applications.

The students are expected to learn and understand:
- using static analysis tools to pinpoint performance hotspots;
- using runtime profiling to characterize the performance profile of applications;
- efficient inter-process communications using MPI;
- "advanced" use of OpenMP directives;
- leveraging compiler builtins, intrinsics, and assembly programming to ensure vectorization.

### Lectures
